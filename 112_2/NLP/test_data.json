        "abstract": " Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses. However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve unique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of machine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature prevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of efficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development. In this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and discuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major solution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We analyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning solutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two image based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning solutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering advantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way the monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",

At the same time, machine learning experts warn that machine learning models can be biased as well. In this article, our goal is to explain the issue of bias in machine learning from a technical perspective and to illustrate the impact that biased data can have on a machine learning model. To reach such a goal, we develop interactive plots to visualizing the bias learned from synthetic data.",

        "abstract": " Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

It could release the burden of data scientists from the multifarious manual tuning process and enable the access of domain experts to the off-the-shelf machine learning solutions without extensive experience.

State-of-the-art techniques adopted in the three categories are presented, including Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm, and gradient-based approaches.

        "abstract": " Machine learning is disruptive. At the same time, machine learning can only succeed by collaboration among many parties in multiple steps naturally as pipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine learning applications, collaboratively training models by multiple parties and delivering machine learning services to end users. Data is critical and penetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning pipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a constructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are fundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article, we survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in machine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces and pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in machine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data collection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also investigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning models, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step of machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future directions.",
