        "abstract": "  Massive Ultracompact Galaxies (MUGs) are common at z=2-3, but very rare in\nthe nearby Universe. Simulations predict that the few surviving MUGs should\nreside in galaxy clusters, whose large relative velocities prevent them from\nmerging, thus maintaining their original properties (namely stellar\npopulations, masses, sizes and dynamical state). We take advantage of the\nhigh-completeness, large-area spectroscopic GAMA survey, complementing it with\ndeeper imaging from the KiDS and VIKING surveys. We find a set of 22 bona-fide\nMUGs, defined as having high stellar mass (>8x10^10 M_Sun) and compact size\n(R_e<2 Kpc) at 0.02 < z < 0.3. An additional set of 7 lower-mass objects\n(6x10^10 < M_star/M_Sun < 8x10^10) are also potential candidates according to\ntypical mass uncertainties. The comoving number density of MUGs at low redshift\n(z < 0.3) is constrained at $(1.0\\pm 0.4)x 10^-6 Mpc^-3, consistent with galaxy\nevolution models. However, we find a mixed distribution of old and young\ngalaxies, with a quarter of the sample representing (old) relics. MUGs have a\npredominantly early/swollen disk morphology (Sersic index 1<n<2.5) with high\nstellar surface densities (<Sigma_e> ~ 10^10 M_Sun Kpc^-2). Interestingly, a\nlarge fraction feature close companions -- at least in projection -- suggesting\nthat many (but not all) reside in the central regions of groups. Halo masses\nshow these galaxies inhabit average-mass groups. As MUGs are found to be almost\nequally distributed among environments of different masses, their relative\nfraction is higher in more massive overdensities, matching the expectations\nthat some of these galaxies fell in these regions at early times. However,\nthere must be another channel leading some of these galaxies to an abnormally\nlow merger history because our sample shows a number of objects that do not\ninhabit particularly dense environments.

One of the most\neffective non-linear filtering approaches, particle filtering, suffers from\nweight degeneracy in high-dimensional filtering scenarios. Several avenues have\nbeen pursued to address high-dimensionality. Among these, particle flow\nparticle filters construct effective proposal distributions by using invertible\nflow to migrate particles continuously from the prior distribution to the\nposterior, and sequential Markov chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) methods use a\nMetropolis-Hastings (MH) accept-reject approach to improve filtering\nperformance.

In addition,\nwe propose a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based particle flow algorithm to\nconstruct effective MH kernels for multi-modal distributions.

Recent approaches for\nfull-body reconstruction use a statistic shape model, which is built upon\naccurate full-body scans of people in skin-tight clothes, to complete invisible\nparts due to occlusion. Such a statistic model may still be fit to an RGB-D\nmeasurement with loose clothes but cannot describe its deformations, such as\nclothing wrinkles. Observed surfaces may be reconstructed precisely from actual\nmeasurements, while we have no cues for unobserved surfaces.

Many of the previous contributions assumed that their formation process\nproceeds similarly to rocky planet formation, via accretion of the satellite\nseeds, called satellitesimals. However, the satellitesimal formation itself\nposes a nontrivial problem as the dust evolution in the circumplanetary disk is\nheavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals\nis hindered. To address this problem, we connected state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical simulations of a circumplanetary disk around a Jupiter-mass\nplanet with dust growth and drift model in a post-processing step. We found\nthat there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a\ndust trap forming within the disk. Thanks to the natural existence of an\noutward gas flow region in the hydrodynamical simulation, a significant dust\ntrap arises at the radial distance of 85~R$_{\\rm J}$ from the planet, where the\ndust-to-gas ratio becomes high enough to trigger streaming instability. The\nstreaming instability leads to the efficient formation of the satellite seeds.\nBecause of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the\nvery short timescale of dust evolution, the circumplanetary disk acts as a\nsatellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles\nthat gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability.\n",

For it\nis claimed that, in certain theories of quantum gravity, spacetime\n'disappears': and this suggests that one may have sensible physical theories in\nwhich spacetime is completely absent. This makes the philosophical question\nwhether such theories are intelligible, even more pressing. And if such\ntheories are intelligible, the question then is how they manage to do so. In\nthis paper, we adapt the contextual theory of scientific understanding,\ndeveloped by one of us, to fit the novel challenges posed by physical theories\nwithout spacetime. We construe understanding as a matter of skill rather than\njust knowledge. The appeal is thus to understanding, rather than explanation,\nbecause we will be concerned with the tools that scientists have at their\ndisposal for understanding these theories. Our central thesis is that such\nphysical theories can provide scientific understanding, and that such\nunderstanding does not require spacetimes of any sort. Our argument consists of\nfour consecutive steps: (a) We argue, from the general theory of scientific\nunderstanding, that although visualization is an oft-used tool for\nunderstanding, it is not a necessary condition for it; (b) we criticise certain\nmetaphysical preconceptions which can stand in the way of recognising how\nintelligibility without spacetime can be had; (c) we catalogue tools for\nrendering theories without a spacetime intelligible; and (d) we give examples\nof cases in which understanding is attained without a spacetime, and explain\nwhat kind of understanding these examples provide.\n",

Those\nmoments are used to evaluate the nodal quasiparticle velocities and their\nspectral weights in the correlated superconducting state. The two velocities\ndetermined in that manner exhibit scaling with the electron concentration\nqualitatively different from that obtained earlier for the excited states of\nthe high-$T_c$ cuprates within the projected quasi-particle ansatz, and the\nresults are in a very good quantitative agreement with experimental data if\ninterpreted as those characterizing the spectrum below and above the observed\nkink. We provide a detailed discussion of the two gaps and two excitation\nbranches (two velocities) appearing naturally within our DE-GWF approach. The\ntwo separate sets of characteristics distinguish the renormalized quasiparticle\nstates very close to the Fermi surface from the deeper correlated-state\nproperties. Also, an enhancement of the $\\mathbf{k}$-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility is shown to contain a spin-fluctuation contribution within our\nlanguage.\n",

Traditional\nspare strategies for satellite constellations cannot handle these\nmega-constellations due to their limited scalability in number of satellites\nand/or frequency of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel spare strategy\nusing an inventory management approach.

The parking orbits (warehouses) are also\nresupplied from the ground (supplier) with stochastic lead time caused by the\norder processing and launch opportunities, leveraging the cost saving effects\nby launching many satellites in one rocket (i.e., batch launch discount). The\nproposed analytical model is validated against simulations using Latin\nHypercube Sampling. Furthermore, based on the proposed model, an optimization\nformulation is introduced to identify the optimal spare strategy, comprising\nthe parking orbits characteristics and all locations policies, to minimize the\nmaintenance cost of the system given performance requirements.

These analyses\naimed to determine the involvement of cognitive and emotional brain regions for\nthese tasks. Results: We observed higher overall likelihood of activation the\nfrontal eye fields in the 3-back.

Furthermore, the 3-back exhibited higher\nactivation in the right SMA, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex versus the\n2-back, and the PASAT exhibited higher activation in a cluster near the right\npremotor area versus the 2-back. A laterality effect was observed in the\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the PASAT (left) and 3-back(right).\nThese data suggest greater activation of regions traditionally associated with\nthe phonological loop during the PASAT, compared to the 2- and 3-back tasks.\nFurthermore, individual ALE analyses suggest involvement of emotional\nprocessing and salience network regions (insula, cingulate) in addition to the\nwell-established verbal working memory regions (Broca's region, bilateral SMA,\npremotor, posterior parietal cortices) in all 3 tasks. Conclusions: Here we\nidentify regions activated by the PASAT, which has not been meta-analytically\nreviewed prior to this study.

The remote observer has access to a\ndiscrete memoryless source, and communicates its observations to the detector\nvia a rate-limited noiseless channel. The detector observes another discrete\nmemoryless source, and performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint\ndistribution of its own observations with those of the observer. While the goal\nof the observer is to maximize the type II error exponent of the test for a\ngiven type I error probability constraint, it also wants to keep a private part\nof its observations as oblivious to the detector as possible. Considering both\nequivocation and average distortion under a causal disclosure assumption as\npossible measures of privacy, the trade-off between the communication rate from\nthe observer to the detector, the type II error exponent, and privacy is\nstudied. For the general HT problem, we establish single-letter inner bounds on\nboth the rate-error exponent-equivocation and rate-error exponent-distortion\ntrade-offs. Subsequently, single-letter characterizations for both trade-offs\nare obtained (i) for testing against conditional independence of the observer's\nobservations from those of the detector, given some additional side-information\nat the detector; and (ii) when the communication rate constraint over the\nchannel is zero.

The key to reasoning\nabout these mixed programs is Siek-Vitousek-Cimini-Boyland's (dynamic) gradual\nguarantee, which says that giving components of a program more precise types\nonly adds runtime type checking, and does not otherwise change behavior. In\nthis paper, we give a semantic reformulation of the gradual guarantee called\ngraduality. We change the name to promote the analogy that graduality is to\ngradual typing what parametricity is to polymorphism. Each gives a\nlocal-to-global, syntactic-to-semantic reasoning principle that is formulated\nin terms of a kind of observational approximation.\n  Utilizing the analogy, we develop a novel logical relation for proving\ngraduality. We show that embedding-projection pairs (ep pairs) are to\ngraduality what relations are to parametricity. We argue that casts between two\ntypes where one is \"more dynamic\" (less precise) than the other necessarily\nform an ep pair, and we use this to cleanly prove the graduality cases for\ncasts from the ep-pair property. To construct ep pairs, we give an analysis of\nthe type dynamism relation (also known as type precision or naive subtyping)\nthat interprets the rules for type dynamism as compositional constructions on\nep pairs, analogous to the coercion interpretation of subtyping.\n",

        "abstract": "  Data-driven methods for improving turbulence modeling in Reynolds-Averaged\nNavier-Stokes (RANS) simulations have gained significant interest in the\ncomputational fluid dynamics community. Modern machine learning algorithms have\nopened up a new area of black-box turbulence models allowing for the tuning of\nRANS simulations to increase their predictive accuracy. While several\ndata-driven turbulence models have been reported, the quantification of the\nuncertainties introduced has mostly been neglected. Uncertainty quantification\nfor such data-driven models is essential since their predictive capability\nrapidly declines as they are tested for flow physics that deviate from that in\nthe training data. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven framework that\nnot only improves RANS predictions but also provides probabilistic bounds for\nfluid quantities such as velocity and pressure. The uncertainties capture both\nmodel form uncertainty as well as epistemic uncertainty induced by the limited\ntraining data. An invariant Bayesian deep neural network is used to predict the\nanisotropic tensor component of the Reynolds stress. This model is trained\nusing Stein variational gradient decent algorithm. The computed uncertainty on\nthe Reynolds stress is propagated to the quantities of interest by vanilla\nMonte Carlo simulation. Results are presented for two test cases that differ\ngeometrically from the training flows at several different Reynolds numbers.\nThe prediction enhancement of the data-driven model is discussed as well as the\nassociated probabilistic bounds for flow properties of interest. Ultimately\nthis framework allows for a quantitative measurement of model confidence and\nuncertainty quantification for flows in which no high-fidelity observations or\nprior knowledge is available.\n",

However, accurate\nestimation of the displacement of myocardial tissue and hence LV strain has\nbeen challenging due to a variety of issues, including those related to\nderiving tracking tokens from images and following tissue locations over the\nentire cardiac cycle. In this work, we propose a point matching scheme where\ncorrespondences are modeled as flow through a graphical network.

However, there\nare some properties of the solar system that are peculiar in this context.\nFirst, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (TNOs) is only a\nfraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system.

In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage.

The minimum set of postulates to be introduced is that\n(i) the action principle should apply and that(ii) the total action should by\nform-invariant under the (local) diffeomorphism group. The second postulate\nthus implements the Principle of General Relativity. According to Noether's\ntheorem, this physical symmetry gives rise to a conserved Noether current, from\nwhich the complete set of theories compatible with both postulates can be\ndeduced. This finally results in a new generic Einstein-type equation, which\ncan be interpreted as an energy-momentum balance equation emerging from the\nLagrangian $L_{R}$ for the source-free dynamics of gravitation and the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the source system $L_{0}$. Provided that the system\nhas no other symmetries -- such as SU$(N)$ -- the canonical energy-momentum\ntensor turns out to be the correct source term of gravitation. For the case of\nmassive spin particles, this entails an increased weighting of the kinetic\nenergy over the mass in their roles as the source of gravity as compared to the\nmetric energy momentum tensor, which constitutes the source of gravity in\nEinstein's General Relativity. We furthermore confirm that a massive vector\nfield necessarily acts as a source for torsion of spacetime. Thus, from the\nviewpoint of our generic Einstein-type equation, Einstein's General Relativity\nconstitutes the particular case for spin-$0$ and massless spin particle fields,\nand the Hilbert Lagrangian $L_{R,H}$ as the model for the source-free dynamics\nof gravitation.\n",

        "abstract": "  The ratio of penumbral to umbral area of sunspots is an important topic for\nsolar and geophysical studies. Hathaway (Solar Physics, 286, 347, 2013) found a\ncurious behaviour in this parameter for small sunspot groups (areas smaller\nthan 100 millionths of solar hemisphere, msh) using records from Royal\nGreenwich Observatory (RGO). Hathaway showed that penumbra-umbra ratio\ndecreased smoothly from more than 7 in 1905 to lower than 3 by 1930 and then\nincreased to almost 8 in 1961. Thus, Hathaway proposed the existence of a\nsecular variation in the penumbra-umbra area ratio. In order to confirm that\nsecular variation, we employ data of the sunspot catalogue published by the\nCoimbra Astronomical Observatory (COI) for the period 1929-1941. Our results\ndisagree with the penumbra-umbra ratio found by Hathaway for that period.\nHowever, the behaviour of this ratio for large (areas greater or equal than 100\nmsh) and small groups registered in COI during 1929-1941 is similar to data\navailable from RGO for the periods 1874-1914 and 1950-1976. Nevertheless, while\nthe average values and time evolution of the ratio in large groups is similar\nto the ratio for small groups according to Coimbra data (1929-1941) it is not\nanalogous for RGO data for the same period. We also found that the behaviour of\nthe penumbra-umbra area ratio for smaller groups in both observatories is\nsignificantly different. The main difference between the area measurements made\nin Coimbra and RGO is associated with the umbra measurements. We would like to\nstress that the two observatories used different methods of observation and\nwhile in COI both methodology and instruments did not change during the study\nperiod, some changes were carried out in RGO that could have affected\nmeasurements of umbra and penumbra. These facts illustrate the importance of\nthe careful recovery of past solar data.\n",

An anomalous electron-optical phonon coupling\nreduction and a bottleneck slowing of hot optical phonons relaxation are\nobserved with higher excitation intensities similar to that in graphene.

Data of the\nstudy Tellus with 90 scans from a single center was used for a 10-fold\ncross-validation in which the most successful configuration for both networks\nwas determined. These configurations were then tested on 20 scans of the\nmulticenter study beta-cell function in JUvenile Diabetes and Obesity\n(BetaJudo), which involved a different study population and scanning device.\n  Results: The U-Net outperformed the used implementation of the V-Net in both\ncross-validation and testing. In cross-validation, the U-Net reached average\ndice scores of 0.988 (VAT) and 0.992 (SAT). The average of the absolute\nquantification errors amount to 0.67% (VAT) and 0.39% (SAT). On the\nmulti-center test data, the U-Net performs only slightly worse, with average\ndice scores of 0.970 (VAT) and 0.987 (SAT) and quantification errors of 2.80%\n(VAT) and 1.65% (SAT).\n  Conclusion: The segmentations generated by the U-Net allow for reliable\nquantification and could therefore be viable for high-quality automated\nmeasurements of VAT and SAT in large-scale studies with minimal need for human\nintervention. The high performance on the multicenter test data furthermore\nshows the robustness of this approach for data of different patient\ndemographics and imaging centers, as long as a consistent imaging protocol is\nused.\n",

While the compute pattern in itself is\nrelatively simple, significant compute and memory challenges remain as CNNs may\ncontain millions of floating-point parameters and require billions of\nfloating-point operations to process a single image. These computational\nrequirements, combined with storage footprints that exceed typical cache sizes,\npose a significant performance and power challenge for modern compute\narchitectures. One of the promising opportunities to scale performance and\npower efficiency is leveraging reduced precision representations for all\nactivations and weights as this allows to scale compute capabilities, reduce\nweight and feature map buffering requirements as well as energy consumption.\nWhile a small reduction in accuracy is encountered, these Quantized Neural\nNetworks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on standard\nbenchmark datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and even ImageNet, and thus\nprovide highly attractive design trade-offs.

        "abstract": "  Falls and their related injuries pose a significant risk to human health. One\nof the most common falls, the forward fall, frequently occurs among adults and\nthe elderly. In this study, we propose using a human body model, developed\nusing the MAthematical DYnamic MOdel (MADYMO) software, in place of human\nsubjects, to investigate forward fall-related injuries. The MADYMO human body\nmodel is capable of simulating items that cannot be assessed on human subjects,\nsuch as human kinematics, human dynamics, and the possibility of injuries. In\norder to achieve our goal, a set of experiments was conducted to measure the\nimpact force during a worst-case forward fall scenario (the outstretched hand\nposition) for two short fall heights. Similar to the experimental design used\non the human subjects, we generated a MADYMO human model. After performing the\nsimulations, the results of the experiment on the human subjects and the MADYMO\nsimulation model were compared. We demonstrated a significant correlation\nbetween the MADYMO simulation and the human subject experiments with respect to\nthe magnitude and timing of the impact forces. Consequently, we validated the\nMADYMO human body model as a means to accurately assess forward fall-related\ninjuries. Additionally, we compared the predicted results of a mathematical\nmodel with the MADYMO human body model. The MADYMO model is reliable and can\ndemonstrate an accurate impact time. Therefore, we conclude that the MADYMO\nhuman model can be utilized as a reliable model to investigate forward\nfall-related injuries from a typical standing position.\n",

In sports medicine, ECG-based analyses are well\nestablished. However, they rarely consider the correspondence of respiratory\nand cardiac activity. Given such mutual influence, we hypothesize that athlete\nmonitoring might be developed with causal inference and that detailed,\ntime-related techniques should be preceded by a more general, time-independent\napproach that considers the whole group of participants and parameters\ndescribing whole signals. The aim of this study was to discover general causal\npaths among cardiac and respiratory variables in elite athletes in two body\npositions (supine and standing), at rest. ECG and impedance pneumography\nsignals were obtained from 100 elite athletes. The mean HR, the RMSSD, its\nnatural logarithm, the mean respiratory rate, the breathing activity\ncoefficients, and the resulting breathing regularity were estimated. Several\ncausal discovery frameworks were applied: generalized correlations, CAM, FGES,\nGFCI, and two Bayesian network learning algorithms: Hill-Climbing and Tabu. The\nmain, still mild, rules best supported by data are: for supine - tidal volume\ncauses heart activity variation, which causes HR, which causes respiratory\ntiming; and for standing - normalized respiratory activity variation causes\naverage heart activity. The presented approach allows data-driven and\ntime-independent analysis of elite athletes as a particular population, without\nconsidering prior knowledge. However, the results seem to be consistent with\nthe medical background. Causality inference is an interesting mathematical\napproach to the analysis of biological responses, which are complex.

Our\nstudy is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS)\nphotometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. We\nconstructed LFs inside a scaled radius using a selection in photometric\nredshift around the cluster spectroscopic redshift in order to reduce\nprojection effects. The width of the photometric redshift selection was\ncarefully determined to avoid biasing the LF and depended on both the cluster\nredshift and the galaxy magnitudes.

To improve robustness and accuracy of detection, especially, in certain\ncritical-care scenarios, the use of additional physiological signals such as\narterial blood pressure (BP) has recently been suggested. There, estimation of\nheartbeat location requires information fusion from multiple signals. However,\nreported efforts in this direction often obtain multimodal estimates somewhat\nindirectly, by voting among separately obtained signal-specific intermediate\nestimates. In contrast, we propose to directly fuse information from multiple\nsignals without requiring intermediate estimates, and thence estimate heartbeat\nlocation in a robust manner. Method: We propose as a heartbeat detector, a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) that learns fused features from multiple\nphysiological signals. This method eliminates the need for hand-picked\nsignal-specific features and ad hoc fusion schemes. Further, being data-driven,\nthe same algorithm learns suitable features from arbitrary set of signals.\nResults: Using ECG and BP signals of PhysioNet 2014 Challenge database, we\nobtained a score of 94%.

In this paper we\nshow a striking counterexample to this intuition via the seemingly trivial\ncoordinate transform problem, which simply requires learning a mapping between\ncoordinates in (x,y) Cartesian space and one-hot pixel space. Although\nconvolutional networks would seem appropriate for this task, we show that they\nfail spectacularly. We demonstrate and carefully analyze the failure first on a\ntoy problem, at which point a simple fix becomes obvious. We call this solution\nCoordConv, which works by giving convolution access to its own input\ncoordinates through the use of extra coordinate channels. Without sacrificing\nthe computational and parametric efficiency of ordinary convolution, CoordConv\nallows networks to learn either complete translation invariance or varying\ndegrees of translation dependence, as required by the end task. CoordConv\nsolves the coordinate transform problem with perfect generalization and 150\ntimes faster with 10--100 times fewer parameters than convolution. This stark\ncontrast raises the question: to what extent has this inability of convolution\npersisted insidiously inside other tasks, subtly hampering performance from\nwithin?

The\nelectrohydrodynamics of a drop is governed by inherent deformability of the\ndrop (defined by capillary number), the electric field strength (defined by\nMasson number) and the surface charge convection (quantified by electric\nReynolds number). Surface charge convection generates nonlinearilty in a\nelectrohydrodynamics problem by coupling the electric field and flow field. In\nStokes limit, most existing theoretical models either considered weak charge\nconvection or weak electric field to solve the problem. In the present work,\ngravitational settling of the drop is investigated analytically and numerically\nin Stokes limit considering significant electric field strength and surface\ncharge convection. Drop deformation accurate upto higher order is calculated\nanalytically in small deformation regime. Our theoretical results show\nexcellent agreement with the numerical and shows improvement over previous\ntheoretical models. For drops falling with moderate Reynolds number, the effect\nof Masson number on transient drop dynamics is studied for (i) perfect\ndielectric drop in perfect dielectric medium (ii) leaky dielectric drop in the\nleaky dielectric medium. For the latter case transient deformation and velocity\nobtained for significant charge convection is compared with that of absence in\ncharge convection which is the novelty of our study. The present study suggests\nthat for both the regimes, surface charge convection tends to increase or\ndecrease the settling speed depending upon the ratios of electrical properties.\nNotably, in the inertial regime, deformation and velocity are seen to be\naltered prominently in the existence of significant charge convection.\n",

Multiple auction\nplatforms, also called Supply-Side Platforms (SSP), were created. Because of\nthis multiplicity, publishers started to create competition between SSPs. In\nthis setting, there are two successive auctions: a second price auction in each\nSSP and a secondary, first price auction, called header bidding auction,\nbetween SSPs.In this paper, we consider an SSP competing with other SSPs for ad\nspaces. The SSP acts as an intermediary between an advertiser wanting to buy ad\nspaces and a web publisher wanting to sell its ad spaces, and needs to define a\nbidding strategy to be able to deliver to the advertisers as many ads as\npossible while spending as little as possible. The revenue optimization of this\nSSP can be written as a contextual bandit problem, where the context consists\nof the information available about the ad opportunity, such as properties of\nthe internet user or of the ad placement.Using classical multi-armed bandit\nstrategies (such as the original versions of UCB and EXP3) is inefficient in\nthis setting and yields a low convergence speed, as the arms are very\ncorrelated.

Here we derive a simple\nanalytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in\nthe ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that\nthe time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by $f(t) \\approx\n(1 + t/t_e)^{-n}$ where $n \\approx 1$ and the timescale $t_e$ is a function of\nthe ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process\nisotopes with radioactive power $\\dot{Q} \\propto t^{-4/3}$, the late time\nkilonova luminosity asymptotes to $L \\propto t^{-7/3}$ and depends\nsuper-linearly on the ejecta mass, $L \\propto M^{5/3}$.

Applied to the kilonova associated with the\ngravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible\nsteepening of the observed light curve at $\\gtrsim 7$ days is unrelated to\nthermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a\nhigh opacity component of ejecta.

This work describes a method to infer voxel-level\ntransformation from higher-level correspondence information contained in\nanatomical labels. We argue that such labels are more reliable and practical to\nobtain for reference sets of image pairs than voxel-level correspondence.\nTypical anatomical labels of interest may include solid organs, vessels, ducts,\nstructure boundaries and other subject-specific ad hoc landmarks. The proposed\nend-to-end convolutional neural network approach aims to predict displacement\nfields to align multiple labelled corresponding structures for individual image\npairs during the training, while only unlabelled image pairs are used as the\nnetwork input for inference. We highlight the versatility of the proposed\nstrategy, for training, utilising diverse types of anatomical labels, which\nneed not to be identifiable over all training image pairs. At inference, the\nresulting 3D deformable image registration algorithm runs in real-time and is\nfully-automated without requiring any anatomical labels or initialisation.\nSeveral network architecture variants are compared for registering T2-weighted\nmagnetic resonance images and 3D transrectal ultrasound images from prostate\ncancer patients. A median target registration error of 3.6 mm on landmark\ncentroids and a median Dice of 0.87 on prostate glands are achieved from\ncross-validation experiments, in which 108 pairs of multimodal images from 76\npatients were tested with high-quality anatomical labels.\n",

There are several equivalent\ndefinitions of graph reassembling; in this report we use a definition which\nmakes it closest to the notion of graph carving. A reassembling is a rooted\nbinary tree whose nodes are subsets of V and whose leaf nodes are singleton\nsets, with each of the latter containing a distinct vertex of G. The parent of\ntwo nodes in the reassembling is the union of the two children's vertex sets.\nThe root node of the reassembling is the full set V. The edge-boundary degree\nof a node in the reassembling is the number of edges in G that connect vertices\nin the node's set to vertices not in the node's set. A reassembling's\nalpha-measure is the largest edge-boundary degree of any node in the\nreassembling. A reassembling of G is alpha-optimal if its alpha-measure is the\nminimum among all alpha-measures of G's reassemblings.\n  The problem of finding an alpha-optimal reassembling of a simple graph in\ngeneral was already shown to be NP-hard.\n  In this report we present an algorithm which, given a 3-regular plane graph G\n= (V,E) as input, returns a reassembling of G with an alpha-measure independent\nof n (number of vertices in G) and upper-bounded by 2k, where k is the\nedge-outerplanarity of G. (Edge-outerplanarity is distinct but closely related\nto the usual notion of outerplanarity; as with outerplanarity, for a fixed\nedge-outerplanarity k, the number n of vertices can be arbitrarily large.) Our\nalgorithm runs in time linear in n.

They serve as\nhigh-performance transducers, sensors, and filters by offering low dissipation,\ntunable coupling to diverse physical systems, and compatibility with a wide\nrange of frequencies, materials, and fabrication processes. Systems of phononic\nresonators typically obey reciprocity, which ensures that the phonon\ntransmission coefficient between any two resonators is independent of the\ndirection of transmission. Reciprocity must be broken to realize devices (such\nas isolators and circulators) that provide one-way propagation of acoustic\nenergy between resonators.

Furthermore, they have been applied only\nto coherent signals (rather than fluctuations or noise), and have been realized\nexclusively in travelling-wave systems (rather than resonators).

The\nstability of the implicit scheme in two-dimensional space is established with\nthe connectivity and regularity conditions. Moreover, with the addition of the\ntime step condition, the stability of the semi-implicit scheme in\ntwo-dimensional space is established. As an application of these results,\nmodified schemes are developed by redefining discrete parameters to\nautomatically satisfy parts of these conditions.\n",

Here, we address\nthis issue by simultaneously taking into account both structural and electronic\ndegrees of freedom using a charge self-consistent combination of density\nfunctional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, together with screened\ninteraction parameters obtained from the constrained random phase\napproximation. Our total energy calculations show that the coupling to an\nelectronic instability towards a charge disproportionated insulating state is\ncrucial to stabilize the structural distortion, leading to a clear first order\ncharacter of the coupled transition. The decreasing octahedral rotations across\nthe series suppress this electronic instability and simultaneously increase the\nscreening of the effective Coulomb interaction, thus weakening the correlation\neffects responsible for the metal-insulator transition. Our approach allows to\nobtain accurate values for the structural distortion and thus facilitates a\ncomprehensive understanding, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of the\ncomplex interplay between structural properties and electronic correlation\neffects across the nickelate series.\n",

Distributed Transmit Beamforming (DTB) techniques\nare being developed to address these two issues to provide reliable\nconnectivity from power-limited distributed users. This paper proposes an\nadaptive Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding scheme for the DTB system. The\nproposed scheme constructs powerful LDPC codes with varying code-rates and\nblock-lengths. This feature of the proposed scheme allows the DTB system to\noptimise its system resources, improve throughput and communicate reliably\nunder large variation of different channel environments. The performance of\nsome of the codes constructed using the proposed scheme is evaluated and\ncompared with the uncoded and other coded-DTB systems. The results obtained\nshow large gains over the compared systems. The results also show that coding\napplied to the DTB system drastically reduces the minimum number of distributed\ntransmit nodes required to achieve a target error-rate with the same energy per\ninformation bit to noise power spectral density.\n",

For causal\ndiscovery, two of these problems are especially important: the enumeration of\nthe constraints imposed by a model, and deciding whether two graphs define the\nsame statistical model. We show how the half-trek criterion can be used to make\nprogress in both of these problems.

Unlike the existing works that require the\nparameters of underwater imaging model estimation or impose inflexible\nframeworks applicable only for specific scenes, our model directly reconstructs\nthe clear latent underwater image by leveraging on an automatic end-to-end and\ndata-driven training mechanism. Compliant with underwater imaging models and\noptical properties of underwater scenes, we first synthesize ten different\nmarine image databases. Then, we separately train multiple UWCNN models for\neach underwater image formation type. Experimental results on real-world and\nsynthetic underwater images demonstrate that the presented method generalizes\nwell on different underwater scenes and outperforms the existing methods both\nqualitatively and quantitatively. Besides, we conduct an ablation study to\ndemonstrate the effect of each component in our network.\n",

        "abstract": "  Source localization based on signal strength measurements has become very\npopular due to its practical simplicity. However, the severe nonlinearity and\nnon-convexity make the related optimization problem mathematically difficult to\nsolve, especially when the transmit power or the path-loss exponent (PLE) is\nunknown. Moreover, even if the PLE is known but not perfectly estimated or the\nanchor location information is not accurate, the constructed data model will\nbecome uncertain, making the problem again hard to solve. This paper\nparticularly focuses on differential received signal strength (DRSS)-based\nlocalization with model uncertainties in case of unknown transmit power and\nPLE. A new whitened model for DRSS-based localization with unknown transmit\npowers is first presented and investigated. When assuming the PLE is known, we\nintroduce two estimators based on an exact data model, an advanced best linear\nunbiased estimator (A-BLUE) and a Lagrangian estimator (LE), and then we\npresent a robust semidefinite programming (SDP)-based estimator (RSDPE), which\ncan cope with model uncertainties (imperfect PLE and inaccurate anchor location\ninformation). The three proposed estimators have their own advantages from\ndifferent perspectives: the A-BLUE has the lowest complexity; the LE holds the\nbest accuracy for a small measurement noise; and the RSDPE yields the best\nperformance under a large measurement noise and possesses a very good\nrobustness against model uncertainties. Finally, we propose a robust SDP-based\nblock coordinate descent estimator (RSDP-BCDE) to deal with a completely\nunknown PLE and its performance converges to that of the RSDPE using a\nperfectly known PLE.\n",
